2. add a post api to fetch 24 hours forecast. (params: same as 1)
3. add test

1. Added benchmark testing â€“ efficiency tested through extensive loop iterations.

2. Debugged and resolved an issue related to accessing a POST API through the frontend: Encountered connection refusal
   error when attempting to access a completed backend using Retrofit on Android. Forgot to include the expected
   response body.
